# âœ… pico-check
An incredibly tiny javascript testing library. Heavily inspired by the wonderful [ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava) and [tape](https://github.com/substack/tape).

<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/pico-check"><img src="https://img.shields.io/npm/v/pico-check?style=flat-square"></img></a>

### Features
- Test cases are just functions
- Supports sync and async tests
- Provides arming/disarming and timeouts for async tests
- Test cases structured as simple objects and functions
- Easy to write custom reporters based on event emitters
- Supports TAP
- Easily flag a test or group to skip, or only run
- Comes with a file watcher to automatically re-run tests on file changes
- Uses built-in `assert` lib when possible
- No dependacies!

## Test Syntax
```js

// Tests are just functions or objects of functions. If the test passes,
// the function returns nothing, if the test fails the function should throw an error.

const check = require('pico-check');

//Test Cases are just nested objects of test functions
const testCases = {
  'testing addition' : (t)=>{
    t.is(3 + 4, 7);
  },
  'async tests' : {
    'promise check' : (t)=>{
      return request(api_url)
        .then((result)=>{
          t.is(result, {code : 200, body : { ok : true }});
        });
    },
    'async/await' :  async (t)=>{
      const bar = Promise.resolve('bar');
      t.is(await bar, 'bar');
    }
  },
  '_skipped test' : (t)=>t.fail()
};

const results = await check(testCases);

console.log(results);

/* Returns the exact same object structure but true if pass, error if fail, and false if skipped
{
  'testing addition': true,
  'async tests': {
    'promise check': AssertionError [ERR_ASSERTION]: Expected values to be loosely deep-equal:
      { code: 404 } should loosely deep-equal { code: 200, body : { ok : true }},
    'async/await': true
  },
  '_skipped test': false
}
*/
```



## Usage

### install

```console
$ npm install --save-dev pico-check
```

### CLI usage
```
{
  "name": "smashing-project",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "pico-check ./tests",
    "test:dev": "pico-check --watch ./tests"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "pico-check": "^2.0.0"
  }
}
```


### Library Usage

```js
const check = require('pico-check');
const reporter = require('pico-check/reporters/basic.reporter.js');
const { summary } = require('pico-check/utils');

const testCases = {
  init$ : (t)=>{
    //This test always runs, even with the only flag
  },
  this_is_a_group : {
    addition_test : (t)=>t.is(3+4, 7),
    $only_test : (t)=>{
      //this test is flagged with a $, so pico-check will skip every other test
    }
  },
  _skipped_test : (t)=>t.fail(),
}


check(testCases, { emitter : reporter })
  .then((results)=>{
    console.log(results)
    const { failed } = summary(results);
    process.exit(failed === 0 ? 0 : 1);
  })
```



## Reporters
`pico-check` can take an reporter event emitter as a optional parameter. As it executes your test cases it will emit various events that your reporter can react too. `pico-check` comes with a basic reporter, as well as a TAP reporter.

### basic reporter (default)
Prints out all testcases in an easy to read format.


### TAP reporter
`pico-check` supports the [TAP format](https://testanything.org/) and will work with [any TAP reporter](https://testanything.org/consumers.html#javascript)

### Custom reporters
You can create your own reporters, just look at the included basic reporter as a basis to create your own.


## Flags

You can flag tests and groups with `_` and `$` in the test name to change the test runner behaviour.

#### Skip Flag - `_test_name`
If a test or group name starts with a `_` the test will be skipped

#### Only Flag - `$test_name`
If a test or group name starts with a `$` the test runner will be set into "only mode", and will only run tests/groups with the Only Flag and the Always Flag.

#### Always Flag - `test_name$`
If a test or group ends with a `$` it will be ran in "only mode", but not set the test runner into "only mode". This is useful for test cases that set up or clean up needed processes for other test cases (such as database connections or setting environment variables).



## Assertion
Each test function will be provided an assertion object as it's first parameter. `pico-check`s assertion object is an extension of node's built-in [assert](https://nodejs.org/api/assert.html), so you can use any of the default assertions. Here are `pico-check`s additional assertions:

#### `t.pass([msg]) / t.fail([msg])`
Passes/fails a test case with an optional message

```js
test('sample', (t)=>{
  (complexCondition ? t.pass() : t.fail('The complex condition failed'))
});
```
#### `t.ok(actual, [msg]) / t.no(actual, [msg])`
Verifies that `actual` is truthy/falsey with an optional message

```js
test('sample', (t)=>{
  t.ok(a == 3);
  t.no(b instanceof Error);
});
```

#### `t.is(actual, expected, [msg]) / t.not(actual, expected, [msg])`
Intelligently chooses between `assert.equal`/`assert.notEqual` or `assert.deepEqual`/`assert.notDeepEqual` based on the type of `expected` and `actual`.

```js
test('sample', (t)=>{
  t.not(3 + 4, 8);
  t.is({a : 6, b : [1,2,3]}, {a:6, b:[1,2,3]});
});
```

#### `t.type(value, type, [msg])`
A shorthand for `assert.equal(typeof value, type, msg)`. Handles arrays as type `'array'`;

```js
test('sample', (t)=>{
  t.type(3, 'number');
  t.type({a:true}, 'object');
  t.type([1,2,3], 'array');
});
```

#### `t.arm([msg]) / t.disarm()`
Sometimes you need a test to implictly fail unless a certain code path is ran. For this use case you can 'prime' your test case to error using `t.arm()`, and stop it from failing by calling `t.disarm()`.

```js
test('emitter fires', (t)=>{
  t.arm('Update event was never caught');
  emitter.on('update', ()=>t.disarm());
  emitter.emit('update');
});
```




## Lifecycle
A common design pattern for testing is to have `before`, `after`, `beforeEach`, and `afterEach` triggers for your test cases. While `pico-check` lacks these functions explicitly, you can replicate this functionality using native javascript, since your tests run syncronously.

#### Before & After
Since tests run sync, the simplist way to achive this is to make a testcase at the beginning or end of your test file.

```js
const tests = {
  start : async ()=>{
    await DB.startup();
  },

  /** Your test cases... **/

  cleanup : async ()=>{
    await DB.shutdown();
  },
}

module.exports = tests;
```

**Notes**:
- If you have many before or after triggers, it's useful to create a group for them to easily turn them off/on, or add it them.
- If you have many test files that use the same before/after triggers, it useful to store the create group/testcases in a separate file and require them in as needed
